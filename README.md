# Programming
The programming of the bot was done by me. I used the GPT-3.5-Turbo model from OpenAI's API token to have an AI model for the bot, for both accurate responses to messages and moderating messages that are detected as harrasement, NSFW, etc. I used discord.js, a JavaScript library with built in classes for handling discord server management. I programmed the commands for the bot, such as moderating chats and welcoming newcomers. This project taught me a couple things, but the main thing it taught me was how effective AI can be when integreated into software. This made me believe that AI is not something we should be concerned about, it's something we should use as a tool to leverage our work and further advance the technical aspects of our products.
